<h2>About US!</h2>

<p>This is a website cooked up by a bored person. Never actually made a website before and wanted to try it     
and its surprisingly easy and fun! I hope this website serves great purpose for weebs and otaku's around the globe!
Its a bit glitchy though but it almost always my fault and not the computers, so if its glitchy email me at 
thewakaranc@gmail.com and i'll try to fix it! thats all! Too Too Ruuu!
